This project is about using A-Star algorithm to find the minimal cost paths between start state and goal state.
In this particular project, we create a map representation which contains areas such as rivers, hard to travel, blocked and unblocked, all of which have different cost of traversal depending on difficulty.
The project has been created in Java with use of Swing for map/grid creation.
